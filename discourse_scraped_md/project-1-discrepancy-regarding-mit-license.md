    Sir,
The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.
*🖼️ Image description: This is a screenshot of a Git repository's file list on a dark-themed interface.  The repository is named "tds_project-1," and shows various files and folders, including a LICENSE file, a requirements file and commits made to the project over the last two months.  The interface includes options for adding files and viewing the code.*image1145×673 33.8 KB
*🖼️ Image description: This is a project evaluation report.  The submission failed because an MIT license was missing from the GitHub repository, resulting in a score of 0.  Other prerequisites (Docker image, GitHub repo, and Dockerfile) passed.*image633×336 7.1 KB
Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

    Hi @22f3000585
Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).
Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs
Kind regards

    *🖼️ Image description: A GitHub submission at the given URL failed because the repository doesn't exist, there's no MIT license, and no Dockerfile.*image931×108 3.89 KB
Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

    Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.
*🖼️ Image description: The image contains instructions regarding submission guidelines.  It specifies that submissions must not contain "MIT" in the LICENSE and must not include a Dockerfile to be considered for scoring.  It also notes that only the latest submission from each student was reviewed, even if multiple submissions were allowed.*Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 4.49.23 PM1776×228 15.5 KB

    @24ds2000125 @22f3000585
I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.
But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.
These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.
Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.
We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.
I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.
Kindest regards

    Sir,
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.
Thankyou!

    One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

    Sir, I received the mail today -
*🖼️ Image description: The image shows a pre-requisites check.  It verifies the existence and public accessibility of Docker and Github repositories (checking for timestamps before February 18th).  It also checks for a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file (MIT License) and a Dockerfile within the Github repository.  Results are indicated by 1 (pass) or 0 (fail).*image652×156 5.43 KB
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.
*🖼️ Image description: A submission to a system (likely a code submission system) at the given GitHub link failed because it lacked a repository, an MIT license, and a Dockerfile.*image836×101 18.2 KB
Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.
*🖼️ Image description: A Git commit history showing six commits to a project, including the creation and renaming of a license file, as well as the addition of several other files.  The commits occurred over a period of two months, with the most recent being five days ago.*image1113×487 20.2 KB
Sir can you please check.
