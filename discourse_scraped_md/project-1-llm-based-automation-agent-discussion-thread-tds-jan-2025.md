    Please post any questions related to Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent.
Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM
Update on 27 Jan 2025:
A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip ¬∑ sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public ¬∑ GitHub
You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.
Please note:

This is a sample. It WILL change.
Don‚Äôt rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change.
LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:

Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations


Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
For those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

    Hi Guddu ,
I didn‚Äôt make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?
command that I used :
uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data
here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}



Possible reasons for this issue:

Not using anand sir‚Äôs proxy url for sending requests.
Token not being correct.

    While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase ‚Äúrecent log file‚Äù, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

    The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.
For more information watch this video https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat or watch TDS Live Sessions.

    Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:
Deliverables,
and an example of the Evaluation has been provided.
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: The image shows instructions for a coding project.  It details the deliverables, including creating a GitHub repository, writing and testing code, creating a Docker image, and publishing it to Docker Hub.  It also includes notes on using an environment variable for an API token and limitations on token usage and model selection.  Finally, it mentions an evaluation section.*Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764√ó1764 374 KB
Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.
So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.
Kind regards

    Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission)  would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible
More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen


In Tuesday‚Äôs(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
Pull an existing docker image.
Run that image inside a container.
Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
Once done you can commit it.
And push customized container‚Äôs image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it‚Äôs a good idea, we will see if it‚Äôs possible to discuss in session.

*üñºÔ∏è Image description: This image shows a list of deliverables for a programming assignment.

Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: This image shows the prerequisites for evaluating a repository.  The repository must be publicly accessible on GitHub, contain a LICENSE file with the MIT license, and a valid Dockerfile.  Additionally, the corresponding Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via a specified `podman run` command, using the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.*Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.26.08 am1460√ó496 45.5 KB
We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.
If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned especially the pre - requisites mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and there will be no appeal for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.
In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.
Kind regards

    Hi Guddu,
We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.
Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.
In this case you would write out the the expected variable in the evaluate.py and see if result variable matches the expected. Then you can figure out what went wrong.
Kind regards

    the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic ‚Äúls‚Äù command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.
Do you think we could access a better model?
Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y‚Äôall run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?
because the model doesn‚Äôt know basic commands after telling how to do it.
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.
I spent a week on this just saying

I‚Äôm confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don‚Äôt know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats.

    Hello everyone, @s.anand @carlton
I had a few queries regarding the project;

I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that‚Äôs already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like ‚Äúpath=/data/format.md‚Äù or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like ‚Äúpath=show the data in format.md‚Äù?
Are we concerned about what‚Äôs shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they‚Äôre flexible? Ex. ‚ÄúCount the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt‚Äù

    @21f3002390 - AI Proxy is working and you did get the result. You can ignore any costError. It won‚Äôt happen in the future anyway.
What‚Äôs happening? I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, crypto.createHash is not supported in CloudFlare. I fixed that by removing this. I‚Äôll introduce caching later if required.

    A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.
For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

    Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.
Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.
The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.
We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.
Kind regards

    @carlton Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?
Some questions about ‚ÄòB‚Äô group tasks:
Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will datagen.py also generate files for these?
Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?
Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?
B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database
B7. Compress or resize an image
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

    its expecting to  match every single detail in that even " and ‚Äô .
in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.
llm will only handle  -calling function based on query and parameter   . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.
If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir @carlton @s.anand

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.
The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was updated on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

    Hi Andrew,
You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.
I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.
In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.
So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task.
That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).
Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)
A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.
Kind regards

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before
Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.
I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

    Hi Telvin
You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: This is a webpage section about Large Language Models (LLMs).  It explains that using LLMs incurs a cost, but API keys are provided with a usage limit of $1 per calendar month.  Instructions are given on how to use an AI proxy instead of OpenAI, requiring a replacement of API and key information.  The page includes navigation links (Previous, Next) and a sidebar with related tools and resources.*Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078√ó1276 305 KB
In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50
As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us!
The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.
In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.
Kind regards

In the Task B5, where we have to run an SQL query on a sqlite or duckdb database, should I create a database on my own and then take the query to be ran on it as an argument? Or should I take the query as an argument and run it on the ticker_sales.db in ./data folder? Please guide

    As in the previous session for task a1 we use llm just to get the url and email , so after retriving the both arguments can i use them in a function and got the work given in work done in function.
Also, am i correct that we use llm only to retrive url or location ??

    For task A2:

A2. Format the contents of /data/format.md using prettier@3.4.2, updating the file in-place

I am getting the following error:
üî¥ A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath', '/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
However, running a POST request to https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2 gives successful output.
{"success":true,"message":"Formatted and verified successfully!"}% 
Here is my code snippet:
def format_file(filepath):
    while True:  # Loop until formatting and verification pass
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", filepath],
                check=False,  # Don't raise exception automatically
                capture_output=True,
                text=True
            )

            if result.returncode != 0:
                return {"success": False, "message": f"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}"}

            if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
                return {"success": True, "message": "Formatted and verified successfully!"}
            else:
                logging.info("Verification failed. Retrying formatting...") #Log the retry
                # If verification fails, the loop continues and prettier --write is executed again.

        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "message": str(e)}

def verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
    try:
        subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--check", filepath], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True) #Capture output
        return True  # File is formatted correctly
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Prettier check failed: {e.stderr}") # Log the error from prettier check
        return False  # File is not formatted correctly

What am I missing here?

    Hi @carlton @Jivraj,
I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>

    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

If i can‚Äôt automate this process, i don‚Äôt see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).
Kindly advise on this @carlton
EDIT : Resolved on a later evaluation

    For the task - * B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data
Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

    Dear Instructors (@carlton, @iamprasna):
Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:
It will solely be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct AIPROXY_TOKEN generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated AIPROXY_TOKENs of the students who have generated one); and the correct $IMAGE_NAME (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000, correct?
Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual AIPROXY_TOKEN is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

Sorting by keys also didn‚Äôt help.

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).
Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

    Hi instructors and TAs,
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don‚Äôt have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.
eg.

Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query‚Äôs response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.
Thanks,

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

You need to download both evaluate.py and datagen.py in same folder and then execute evaluate.py using uv.
uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email.

This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.
The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.
What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

1. podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME works fine
2.  Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

    Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: This image shows instructions on how to run a docker image named `$IMAGE_NAME` using `podman`. The command includes environment variables for an AI proxy token, and maps port 8000 to the container.  The resulting API is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`.*
The command:
podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
gives the error:
crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found
However the correct command seems to be:
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
This works totally fine.

    One final question @Jivraj @carlton , will our projects be evaluated with our AIPROXY_TOKEN or a different one.
Because my project is done but for evaluation if my AIPROXY_TOKEN is used, it might be out of credits.

    A silly Doubt though but still a doubt!
Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my ‚Äúapp.py‚Äù is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.
Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py
Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!
plz reply!!

    Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 ‚Äî


B6. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website


B3. Fetch data from an API and save it


They are almost similar and it‚Äôs getting confusing in both cases, it‚Äôs given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?
Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

give proper permissions.
use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach

    For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

    Hi,
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

    Hi @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj ,
In task A6
Find all Markdown (.md ) files in /data/docs/ . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with #  ). Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename (without the /data/docs/ prefix) to its title (e.g. {"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...} ).
Here expected output JSON ‚Äúkey‚Äù is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when ‚Äúpath/to/large-language-models.md‚Äù is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is ‚Äúpath/to/large-language-models.md‚Äù.

    This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key.

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the ‚Äú#‚Äù symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.

sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have
‚Äô
''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,

    get_logs,
    get_docs,

    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first‚Ä¶
Or it should be the part of the automation only‚Ä¶

    Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

    If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‚Äò#‚Äô and change it to ‚Äònumber‚Äô and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.
Or another approach is tell the llm,
If you ever see the phrase ‚Äòcount the # of‚Äô in a task, please interpret it as ‚Äòcount the number of‚Äô. For example
Count the # of Fridays means
Count the number of Fridays

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.
Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

    Hey @carlton @Jivraj , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.
But since I was actively testing with the - datagen.py and evaluate.py, I forgot to remove them before submission.
However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

    The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.
For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.
Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.
Kind regards

    it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.
create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.
It even happened for me
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: A terminal window shows an error message ("externally-managed-environment") while attempting to install the NumPy Python package.  The message explains that the system is preventing the installation because it's externally managed and suggests creating a virtual environment or using `pipx` as alternatives.  The error is successfully resolved by activating a virtual environment.*Screenshot_20250215_1433573841√ó1009 237 KB

    you have to give the AIPROXY_TOKEN to the evaluate.py by either
bash - export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"
or
powershell - $env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.
so you have to set AIPROXY_TOKEN in both terminals
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

    Blunder in your main.py.
You are using API_KEY = os.getenv(‚ÄúAI_PROXY_TOKEN‚Äù) but it should be AIPROXY_TOKEN.
Btw what you using for phase B?

    What we expect in project.

server running inside docker container at 8000.
And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

    No don‚Äôt do that, just follow the procedure.
Two problems with keeping token in file.

It will become public after you push to github.
While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

    On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.
evaluate.py:
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a digital image of a shiny, red circle.  It resembles a ball or a bubble.* A2 failed: Command ‚Äò[‚Äònpx‚Äô, ‚Äòprettier@3.4.2‚Äô, ‚Äò‚Äìstdin-filepath‚Äô, ‚Äòdata/format.md‚Äô]‚Äô returned non-zero exit status 2.
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a red 'X' symbol on a black background.  It's a simple, somewhat rounded, graphic representation of the letter X.* A2 FAILED
bash:
npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md
bash works as expected. Can someone help?

Hi ,
I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.
When i run command docker build -t ___________ .
the error that comes is :
Dockerfile:2
1 |     # Use a lightweight Python image
2 | >>> FROM python:3.12-slim
3 |
4 |     # Set the working directory in the container

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn‚Äôt work.
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.
on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use
Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running
Thank You.
Regards,
Aagman

    @carlton needed a confirmation on this task
A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.
My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

    Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.


Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

    @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
When I run my docker image using
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.
Running the same image using
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
works fine and Task A2 passes. I can‚Äôt understand why this is happening.
I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.
When run using docker, which node gives /usr/bin/node as output but when run using podman, nothing.
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh

Most people are still prompting wrong.

I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Here‚Äôs how it works: pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ*üñºÔ∏è Image description: This image shows a breakdown of an "o1 prompt," which is a type of prompt used in AI systems.  The prompt requests a list of three unique, medium-length hikes near San Francisco, with specific details about each hike.

    There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

    Hello  @carlton Sir,
While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected  and actual output is having difference like ‚Äú\n‚Äù then also it marks task as fail.

*üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a red "X" symbol on a black background.  It's a simple, somewhat rounded, graphic representation of the letter X.* A5 FAILED
Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?

    Use following as first parameter of subprocess.run() to create data/ directory inside your project instead of C: drive
["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]

Also, you don‚Äôt need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

    The reason for error is evaluate.py is trying to import datagen.py which doesn‚Äôt exist in your system. I‚Äôll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run evaluate.py from your computer

    Yes actually Thats my doubt , when I run both in same folder it is working , but only after task a1 runs datagen.py will be downloaded in /data folder  right ?,
or did I misunderstood something??

Repository Link: GitHub - 23f2005593/tds
Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.
If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.
Please contribute to this repository. We will win together.

    sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (.md ) files in /data/docs/ . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with #  ). Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename (without the /data/docs/ prefix) to its title (e.g. {"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...} )   ‚Ä¶I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.
my result- { ‚Äúbudget.md‚Äù: ‚ÄúSuccess easy same main modern doctor.‚Äù,
‚Äúbuild.md‚Äù: ‚ÄúShoulder follow own never above.‚Äù,
and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.-  # Series dog who make specific agree between.
my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md    @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton

    Check the file once, there is a possibility that it‚Äôs either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

    This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it‚Äôs value to your API Key then try.

    Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:
bash
Copy
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn‚Äôt include the "data" key.
What I‚Äôve Tried

Token Verification:


I‚Äôm using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email.
The token is passed in the header as follows:

python
Copy
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"


I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).


API Request Details:


The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header.
The payload is set as:

json
Copy
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}


Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.


Debug Output:
Here‚Äôs a snippet of the debug output:

bash
Copy
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
üî¥ A9 failed: 'data'

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.
What I Suspect

The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I‚Äôm not aware of.
Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

Request for Help
Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance for your assistance!

    **Posted on:** 2025-02-16 13:55 UTC  

    I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using podman rmi -a and then ran podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here. But this gave me the following error:
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.
The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent
I‚Äôm not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

    I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.
Shall I just change the name of the file from ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô to ‚ÄòDockerfile‚Äô in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

    Dear @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , and @Saransh_Saini
Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.
@carlton Sir, yesterday‚Äôs session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.
I sincerely appreciate everyone‚Äôs guidance and support.

    Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.


Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1,  link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

    @s.anand @carlton
Dear Sir,
I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.
I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.
I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.
I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.
Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.
Sincerely,
Rishit Jain
(24F2004595)

    I don‚Äôt think the project is too difficult to implement‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren‚Äôt very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

@carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.
