        Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 2 - Deployment Tools.

Important Instruction
Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide.
A friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs! *üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a simple yellow smiley face emoticon.  It has two small black dots for eyes and a small, slightly curved line for a mouth.*

        Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.
Try adding CORS to your code it might work.
Kind regards
Jivraj

        Hi Mishkat,
Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.
eg
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.
Thanks and kind regards

        Hi Mishkat,
This error is because you are filtering on class_ instead of class
So if you send a request on http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S you will see response for that 1S class only.
kind regards

        Hi Guddu,
Inside index.html file of your repo, don‚Äôt put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.
This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that‚Äôs on page.
kind regards.

        I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: A Docker Desktop error message indicates an unexpected WSL error.  It suggests shutting down WSL using the command `wsl --shutdown`, rebooting, or reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop.  The detailed error shows WSL2 is not supported with the current configuration.  Options to gather diagnostics and quit are provided.*Docker Desktop Error558√ó377 27 KB
I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).
wsl --version
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65

DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

        Hi Telvin,
Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.
I solved this question in github codespace, which didn‚Äôt require me to make any changes in network.
kind regards

        @Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

        @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.

        **Posted on:** 2025-01-14 12:52 UTC  

        @22f2001640 in that case

a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll work.
