        @carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.
Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

The currently signed-in user's email address is displayed.  An illustration depicts a person entering a document.*image1756√ó1156 149 KB
Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?
