        I missed a weekâ€™s worth of learning, and Iâ€™d like to catch up by attempting the assignments after going through the video tutorials. Iâ€™m not asking for grades as deadline is passed, just the opportunity to complete them for the sake of learning. I would really appreciate if this can be made possible.
