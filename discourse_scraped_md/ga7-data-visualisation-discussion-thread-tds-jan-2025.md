    Hi @carlton,
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

    @Jivraj
In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are
*🖼️ Image description: Sheet 1 contains columns for Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value.*
but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”
*🖼️ Image description: The image shows a table with data about a series.  Columns include Series ID, Year, Period, Label, and Value.  Two rows of data are visible, showing data for January and February of 2023.  The Series ID appears to be PCU3254-3254-.  Numeric values are present in the Value column.*

    Below items don’t have prices.

Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations




PCU3254123254127114
Calcium channel blockers

Miscellaneous receipts

Antacids

Secondary products

ACE inhibitors



Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

    Hi Tanya,
Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.
Kind regards

    The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

    Hi @carlton sir,
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.
Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

    Sir,
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.
In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?
Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

    If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest and yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

    You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
