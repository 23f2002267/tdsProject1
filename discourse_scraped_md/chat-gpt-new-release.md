        Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited *üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a yellow emoticon with a large, pink tongue sticking out.  The emoticon has simple black eyes.*
Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course
I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next *üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a simple yellow smiley face emoticon with small, black eyes and a small, curved smile.*
*üñºÔ∏è Image description: A screenshot shows a code editor with Python code that fetches and parses a Wikipedia page to generate a Markdown outline.  The left pane displays a ChatGPT conversation regarding a solution to a  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` error, which has been addressed by using `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable. The bottom of the right pane shows a successful run message.*Screenshot 2025-02-07 at 7.08.14 PM1920√ó1012 120 KB
