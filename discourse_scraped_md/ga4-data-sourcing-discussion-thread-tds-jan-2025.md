        @22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

        In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?
edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

        Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.
Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

        @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

        Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

        Hi Tushar,
If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

import pathlib

I don’t understand why I am getting

Error: At root: Different number of properties

Is it because of different dates? Shall I match the dates?
@carlton Please guide. Thank you.

        I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.
Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,
below error is still observed.

Did anyone else face same issue ?

Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.

        @21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

        This is the only thing which worked for me.
@carlton Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is:

        Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.
I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?
In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.
For the particular instance - “2024–”, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

        For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

        That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.
But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

        Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate & enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days)
Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference.
Code:

json_data=response.json()
print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")

weather_data = {}

for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
  issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
  weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']

        I have got the same error as well, verified there are workflows run in my repo/actions/runs
When I checked the reasons, it could be due to API limit exceeded in a hour, but tried even after some time but no workflows found.

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

        The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

Please help with the second issue.

For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.


Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.


I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

        first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors
yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.
but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

if you look closely the expected value is 2024-  and actual that you are supplying is 2024.
Difference ? your value does have a - and a space at the end.
reason ? you might be scraping it ? trim() or maybe using innerText to get tag’s text ?

        it seems we are intended to provide country specific versions for Individual students simulating being an analyst for MNC in various locations. Clearly you got Spain and I seem to have gotten France, although it doesn’t seem to be mentioned in the question itself.

the movie may have  different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks

        Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”
What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
*🖼️ Image description: The image shows a coding exercise.  The instructions describe how to use the BBC Weather API to get a weather forecast for Nur-Sultan, process the data, and create a JSON object representing the forecast.

Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database:

Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.
Hoping for a positive response.

        It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.
