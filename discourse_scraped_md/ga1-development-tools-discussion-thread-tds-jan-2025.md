    Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 1 - Development Tools.

Important Instruction
Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide.
A friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs! *üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a simple yellow smiley face emoticon.  It has two small, dark eyes and a small, curved smile.*

    *üñºÔ∏è Image description: The image shows a programming question.  It instructs the user to download a zip file, extract it, move all files into a single folder, rename the files incrementing each digit, and then determine the output of a specific bash command on that folder.  The command uses `grep`, `sort`, and `sha256sum` to process the files.*image1296√ó158 7.29 KB
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x.txt ‚Üí 3h4q0x.txt
eb209nmlca.txt ‚Üí eb310nmlca.txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 ‚Üí 210 is not working

    Hi anant,
Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.
In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

    Hi manmeet,
I don‚Äôt know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

    2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn‚Äôt submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.
When I logged in today it says score is 0.
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?
If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?

    ### üí¨ Post 28 by @carlton  
    **Posted on:** 2025-01-13 07:21 UTC  

    The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to *üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a blue rectangular button with a white border, displaying the word "Save" in a light-colored sans-serif font.* the submissions to get a score for the GA.
The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or
on the Tools in Data Science introduction page.
Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.
As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. *üñºÔ∏è Image description: That's a green square with a large white checkmark in the center.  It's a common symbol indicating completion, confirmation, or agreement.*
We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.
For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.
Kind regards

I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn‚Äôt click on the button ‚ÄúSubmit Answers‚Äù on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)

    **Posted on:** 2025-01-13 09:05 UTC  

    Hi @Nelson
Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).
Kind regards

    ### üí¨ Post 31 by @carlton

    It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value.

    Hi Shouvik,
Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.
Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn‚Äôt require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

    This is regarding Question 11.
I have extracted all the elements and added them manually. Tried all the options. Not even one appears to be correct . I evne tried ChatGPT which gave the answer as 411. Which of the following should be chosen?

        <div class="bar baz" data-value="17">
          <div class="baz foo" data-value="29"></div>

    @Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845
If you are on Windows Powershell
Then instead of sha256sum you can simply use Get-FileHash
Send the output of the npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md to a text file eg. output.txt and then use Get-FileHash on powershell with the output.txt and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.
You might be able to pipe the data directly to Get-FileHash but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.
Kind regards

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.
I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.
Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?
If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

7E‚Ä¶E5
Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt
A Hash is a nearly unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

    Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

    Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I‚Äôve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.
I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of 80 out of 100. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as ‚Äúabsent‚Äù for this particular assignment.
I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?
