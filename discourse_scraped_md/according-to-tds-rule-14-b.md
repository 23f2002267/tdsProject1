“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”
So I did. *🖼️ Image description: That's a simple, blocky cartoon drawing of a person with brown hair and a teal shirt, extending one arm to the side.  The style is reminiscent of a low-resolution emoji or avatar.*

*🖼️ Image description: That's a cartoon image of a puppy's head.  It's light tan with brown ears and a brown patch over one eye.  Its tongue is sticking out.**🖼️ Image description: That's a simple, isometric illustration of a black graduation cap with a gold tassel.* Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments *🖼️ Image description: That's an illustration of a small stack of three books, with red, dark-green/black, and blue covers.  The books are slightly offset, creating a casual, stacked look.**🖼️ Image description: That's a simple, pixelated image of a light blue laptop computer.  The screen is dark and blank.*
Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.
But let’s be real…
It was my Labrador who did the actual work *🖼️ Image description: That's a cartoon image of a German Shepherd dog wearing a reddish-pink service vest and a bright blue light bar across its back.**🖼️ Image description: That's a pixelated image of a pink human brain.*
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.
He growled at broken APIs.
I took the credit. *🖼️ Image description: That's a pixel art image of a hand with red nail polish being painted.  The hand is stylized and simple in design.*

*🖼️ Image description: That's a cartoon drawing of a red and white megaphone.* Message from the Dog Developer:

“Thank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.
But I am personally offended by one thing…”


“How dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?
I skipped it — just like many — because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.
I demand justice. And a belly rub.”
– *🖼️ Image description: That's a simple cartoon drawing of a dog's head.  The dog is light beige with brown ears and a brown patch over one eye. Its tongue is hanging out.*, Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist


*🖼️ Image description: That's an image of two blue paw prints on a black background.  They appear to be simple, pixelated representations.* Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework.
You get the grade. They get the rage.

    After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t hurt him any further.

    I think you feed your dog desi ghee instead of pedigree
